## üöÄ Approach

Each project follows a structured EDA pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**  
   Imported datasets in `.csv` format and read them into pandas DataFrames.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed missing or duplicate values  
   - Renamed and reformatted columns  
   - Handled null entries and corrected datatypes  

3. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Generated descriptive statistics  
   - Analyzed distributions and correlations  
   - Created visual breakdowns using plots and graphs  

4. **Insight Generation**  
   Identified actionable patterns and key takeaways to inform decisions or next steps.

5. **Visualization**  
   Plotted bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots to make the insights more intuitive.
