# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects using Python

Welcome to the **EDA | Python** repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing a collection of data exploration projects where I dive deep into various datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights using Python.

## 🔍 What is EDA?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the critical first step in any data science or analytics project. It involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often with visual methods, before making any assumptions or building models.

## 🧠 Objective

The aim of these projects is to:
- Clean and preprocess raw data
- Understand the structure and relationships in datasets
- Discover hidden trends, anomalies, and patterns
- Visualize insights using charts and graphs
- Build a foundation for deeper analysis or model building
